Search for TODO comments in the codebase and fix them.

Steps:
1. Find all TODO comments in TypeScript/React files
2. Analyze each TODO and understand what needs to be done
3. Prioritize based on importance and complexity
4. Implement the fixes for high-priority TODOs
5. Update or remove the TODO comments after fixing

Focus on:
- API endpoints that need implementation
- UI components with missing features
- Performance optimizations
- Security improvements
- Error handling
